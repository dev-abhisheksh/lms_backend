A **backend-first Learning Management System (LMS)** built with **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Redis**, designed to handle **real academic workflows**, **secure access control**, and **AI-assisted ontent description improvements.**.

This backend focuses on **correctness, scalability, and production-grade design**, not UI shortcuts.  
Every major feature is implemented with **middleware-level security, caching discipline, and failure-safe design**.

---

## 🎯 What This Backend Demonstrates

This project is built to show **how real LMS backends are designed**, not how demos are made.

It demonstrates:

- Role-based access control enforced at API level
- Hierarchical academic data modeling
- Redis used as an **optimization layer**, not a dependency
- AI integrated as an **assistive service**, not core logic
- Strict separation between controllers, services, and infrastructure
- Defensive backend design (graceful fallbacks, validation everywhere)

---

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Protected routes using middleware
- Role-based access control:
  - **Admin**
  - **Instructor**
  - **Student**

Authorization is enforced **on every protected read and write**, not just UI-side.

---

### 📚 Academic Structure
- **Departments**
- **Courses**
- **Modules**
- **Lessons**

Hierarchical structure enforced at database and API level:

Department → Course → Module → Lesson

Unauthorized access is blocked even if valid IDs are provided.

---

### 🧑‍🎓 Enrollment & Submissions
- Secure course enrollment validation
- Assignment creation (Instructor-only)
- Student submissions
- Submission ownership enforcement
- Submission data modeled separately for scalability

---

### 🧠 AI-Assisted Learning (Service-Based)

AI is implemented via a **dedicated service layer**, not mixed into controllers.

#### AI Capabilities:
- Lesson summaries and explanations
- Prompt isolation per feature (no shared prompt pollution)

AI failures **never block core LMS functionality**.

---

### ⚡ Caching Layer (Redis)

- Redis caching is applied to **read-heavy academic entities** to reduce database load and improve API response times.
- Cached data includes:
  - **Department data** and department–course mappings
  - **Course metadata**
  - **Module structure**
  - **Lesson content and hierarchy**
  - **Assignment metadata** (title, description, deadlines)

- **Submissions are intentionally not cached** due to their write-heavy, user-specific, and consistency-critical nature.

- Automatic cache invalidation is performed on all **write operations** (create, update, delete) for the above entities to prevent stale data.

- Redis is treated strictly as an **optimization layer**:
  - MongoDB remains the source of truth
  - APIs gracefully fall back to MongoDB if Redis is unavailable
  - Authorization checks are enforced after cache retrieval


Caching is **selective**, not global.

---

### 🚦 Rate Limiting
- Redis-backed atomic rate limiting
- IP-based limits for public endpoints
- User-based limits for authenticated requests
- Stricter limits for auth and write APIs

Prevents brute-force attacks and abuse.

---

### 🧾 Audit Logging
- AI usage audit logs
- Tracks:
  - AI requests
  - Feature context
  - Request metadata

Useful for monitoring, debugging, and future analytics.

---

## 🧠 Design Principles (Important)

- Redis is an **optimization**, not a single point of failure
- AI is **assistive**, never authoritative
- Authorization always happens server-side
- Controllers stay thin, logic lives in services
- Read-heavy data cached, write-heavy data never cached

These decisions are **intentional**, not accidental.

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js  
- **Framework:** Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB + Mongoose  
- **Caching & Rate Limiting:** Redis  
- **Authentication:** JWT  
- **AI Integration:** External LLM APIs (Gemini / OpenAI)  
- **Environment Management:** dotenv
